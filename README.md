# Game_of_life-Diane_VERBECQ-DIA6
Game of life implementation with python in the context of the Decentralization Technologies course

## Description

**Game of Life** is a terminal-based Python implementation of John Conway's famous cellular automaton. This project simulates the evolution of cells on a 20x20 grid, following simple rules of survival and reproduction. The initial grid is randomly generated, and the simulation runs indefinitely until the user stops it manually.

Key features:
- A randomly initialized grid with configurable density for live cells.
- A clean, dynamic terminal display.
- Simple rules of cell evolution:
  - A live cell with 2 or 3 neighbors survives.
  - A dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes alive.
  - All other cells die or remain dead.

This project is a fun way to explore emergent patterns and chaos in a minimalistic terminal environment.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or newer.
- A terminal or command prompt with basic Python support.

### Steps to Run

1. Clone or download the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dianevrb/Game_of_life-Diane_VERBECQ-DIA6.git
   cd Game_of_life-Diane_VERBECQ-DIA6
   ```

2. Run the `main` Python script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. Watch the simulation evolve in your terminal.

4. To exit the simulation, press `Ctrl+C`. The program will terminate gracefully.
